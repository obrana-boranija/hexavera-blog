# Enhancing Blazor Navigation: Introducing EnhancedNavigationInterceptor

In modern web development, smooth user experiences are crucial. One often overlooked aspect is handling page scroll behavior during navigation in single-page applications. Today, I'm excited to introduce EnhancedNavigationInterceptor, a Blazor component that elegantly solves this challenge.

## The Navigation Challenge

When users navigate between pages in a Blazor application, they might find themselves stuck at their previous scroll position instead of starting at the top of the new page. This creates a jarring experience and forces users to manually scroll up. EnhancedNavigationInterceptor addresses this issue by automatically managing scroll behavior during navigation.

## Component Overview

EnhancedNavigationInterceptor is a lightweight component that:

- Automatically scrolls to the top on page navigation
- Provides configurable scroll behavior options
- Integrates seamlessly with Blazor's navigation system
- Requires minimal setup and configuration

## Implementation

Here's the complete component implementation:

```razor
@((MarkupString)script)

@functions {
    private MarkupString script => (MarkupString)GetScript();
}

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public ScrollBehavior Behavior { get; set; } = ScrollBehavior.Auto;

    private string GetBehaviorString()
    {
        return Behavior switch
        {
            ScrollBehavior.Smooth => "smooth",
            ScrollBehavior.Instant => "instant",
            ScrollBehavior.Auto => "auto",
            _ => "instant"
        };
    }

    private string GetScript()
    {
        var behavior = GetBehaviorString();
        return $@"
            <script>
                (function() {{
                    let currentUrl = window.location.href;
                    Blazor.addEventListener('enhancedload', () => {{
                        let newUrl = window.location.href;
                        if (currentUrl != newUrl) {{
                            window.scrollTo({{ top: 0, left: 0, behavior: '{behavior}' }});
                        }}
                        currentUrl = newUrl;
                    }});
                }})();
            </script>
        ";
    }

    public enum ScrollBehavior
    {
        Auto,
        Instant,
        Smooth
    }
}
```

## How It Works
The component leverages Blazor's navigation events and the browser's native scrolling capabilities:

1. It injects a small JavaScript snippet that monitors URL changes
2. When navigation occurs, it detects the URL change through Blazor's 'enhancedload' event
3. The component then automatically scrolls to the top using the configured behavior
4. All of this happens seamlessly without any visible interference
   
## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the package via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Boranija.Blazor.Navigation
```

### Basic Usage
Add the component to your MainLayout.razor or App.razor:

```razor
<EnhancedNavigationInterceptor />
```

### Customizing Scroll Behavior
Choose from three scroll behaviors:

```razor
<EnhancedNavigationInterceptor Behavior="ScrollBehavior.Smooth" />
```

Available options:

- `ScrollBehavior.Smooth`: Animated smooth scrolling
- `ScrollBehavior.Instant`: Immediate position change
- `ScrollBehavior.Auto`: Browser's default behavior

Performance Considerations
The component is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- No external dependencies
- Efficient event handling
- Zero impact on initial page load

Browser Compatibility
EnhancedNavigationInterceptor works across all modern browsers:

- Chrome 61+
- Firefox 36+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 79+
  
Future Enhancements
I'm actively working on new features:

- Scroll position preservation option
- Custom scroll offset support
- Scroll to hash functionality
- Animation duration configuration
- Enhanced mobile support

## Conclusion
`EnhancedNavigationInterceptor` provides a simple yet powerful solution for managing scroll behavior in Blazor applications. By implementing this component, you can significantly improve your application's navigation experience with minimal effort.
