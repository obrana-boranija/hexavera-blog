# From Time Tracking to Productivity Insights: Hexavera BI Integrations

Raw time tracking data is only the beginning. To drive operational excellence in manufacturing, leaders need to transform workforce data into actionable insights. Hexavera makes this possible by integrating seamlessly with Business Intelligence (BI) tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Google Looker.

## Why BI Matters in Manufacturing Workforce Management

Manufacturing environments generate vast amounts of workforce data:

- Shift patterns
- Attendance records
- Overtime hours
- Productivity KPIs
- Access control logs

However, without proper analytics, this data remains underutilized. Integrating Hexavera with your BI stack unlocks advanced insights, helping you make smarter, faster decisions.

## How Hexavera BI Integration Works

Hexavera streams real-time workforce data directly into your BI platforms, providing:

### 1. Unified Data Flow
- Combine HRIS, SCADA/MES, time tracking, and attendance data in a single dashboard.
- Remove data silos between HR, operations, and finance teams.

### 2. Custom Dashboards for Every Role
- **HR:** Attrition rates, absenteeism trends, skills gap forecasts.
- **Operations:** Labor costs, productivity by line, downtime correlation.
- **Executives:** Workforce efficiency ratios, cost per unit produced.

### 3. Predictive Analytics
- Forecast labor shortages and overtime risks.
- Predict impact of shift changes on production throughput.

### 4. Automated Reporting
- Schedule reports for daily operational meetings.
- Export data for compliance and audits.

## Benefits for Manufacturing Leaders
