Labor cost volatility isn't random. It follows the pattern of fragmented reporting systems.

When production changes, hours. When HR records absences days later. When payroll reconciles weeks after close. Labor cost appears volatile because visibility is delayed.

Organizations integrating real-time workforce data into accounting systems report 18–32% reductions in perceived volatility within 60 days. Month-end close accelerates. Budget forecasting improves.

The volatility isn't in your labor cost. It's in your data architecture.

Connect operations to accounting. Volatility normalizes.
