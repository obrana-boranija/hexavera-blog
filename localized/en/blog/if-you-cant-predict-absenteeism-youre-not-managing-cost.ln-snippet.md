Absenteeism isn't unpredictable. Your response to it is.

Absence patterns cluster by department and day. Seasonal trends are measurable. Role-specific absence rates are quantifiable. Yet most organizations treat every absence as an operational surprise, requiring reactive premium overtime to fill coverage gaps.

Predictive absence modeling reveals what historical data already shows: you can forecast absence 24–48 hours ahead with 65–80% accuracy. Proactive scheduling replaces reactive premium pay. Labor cost variance narrows 18–32%. Margin stability improves.

The financial difference isn't in eliminating absence. It's in responding to absence before coverage gaps occur. [LINK]
