Workforce forecasting is not a data science exercise. It is a strategic advantage.

Organizations forecasting labor cost within ±2–4% accuracy maintain margin discipline within 3–5% variance. Those relying on historical actuals accept 15–25% monthly swings.

The difference is not sophistication. It is integration.

When scheduling, absence, and turnover data align in real-time, tomorrow's labor cost becomes knowable today. Margin becomes predictable. Budget guidance becomes defensible. Financial planning transitions from reactive to strategic.

CFOs operating with predictive labor cost models control outcomes. Those operating without control become surprised by them.
