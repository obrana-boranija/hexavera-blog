Overtime drift isn't random. It follows the pattern of disconnected workforce systems.

When production signals don't reach HR. When absences aren't flagged in real time. When shift swaps are approved without production context. Overtime becomes the default response to planning gaps.

Organizations integrating production planning with workforce scheduling report 14–28% overtime reductions within 6 months. Margin variance narrows. Budget forecasting improves.

The issue isn't labor discipline. It's data architecture.

Connect production to scheduling. Overtime normalizes.
