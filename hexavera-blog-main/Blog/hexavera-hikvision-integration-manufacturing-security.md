# Enhancing Manufacturing Security: Hexavera & HikVision Integration Deep Dive

In high-paced manufacturing environments, physical security and workforce visibility are paramount. Hexavera’s integration with HikVision brings real-time access control directly into your workforce management platform, elevating both safety and operational efficiency.



## Why Access Control Matters in Manufacturing

Manufacturing sites handle sensitive equipment, hazardous materials, and complex workflows. A lapse in access control can lead to:

- **Safety Risks:** Unauthorized personnel operating dangerous machinery.
- **Compliance Violations:** Breach of health & safety regulations.
- **Operational Disruptions:** Unaccounted site entries leading to security incidents.

Hexavera ensures your access control is not just a standalone system but a strategic part of your integrated workforce platform.

## How Hexavera & HikVision Work Together

Hexavera connects directly to HikVision access control devices to deliver:

### 1. Real-Time Entry and Exit Logs
Access events from HikVision devices are streamed live into Hexavera, providing instant visibility into:

- Who is on-site, right now
- Entry/exit timestamps
- Access point utilization

### 2. Automated Workforce Attendance
Eliminate manual punch clocks. Hexavera automatically updates attendance records based on access control events, ensuring accurate time tracking.

### 3. Compliance-First Control
Integrate worker certifications and roles with physical access permissions:

- **Certification Expiry:** Automatically restrict access if mandatory training lapses.
- **Role-Based Access:** Define granular permissions by job role, shift, or location.

### 4. Incident Response & Audit Trails
Enable rapid incident investigations with comprehensive audit trails:

- Filter access logs by employee, time, or location.
- Export logs for regulatory compliance reporting.

## Integration Workflow: Step by Step

1. **Connect Hexavera to HikVision Network:** Securely authenticate and connect to HikVision devices.
2. **Map Employees to Access Credentials:** Link employee profiles with physical access tokens.
3. **Enable Real-Time Sync:** Stream access data into Hexavera's monitoring dashboards.
4. **Configure Rules & Alerts:** Set up automated triggers for unauthorized access or compliance breaches.

## Business Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety:** Proactively prevent access violations.
- **Operational Transparency:** Know exactly who is on-site, at any moment.
- **Audit-Ready Compliance:** Simplify preparation for safety inspections and audits.
- **Integrated Workforce View:** Combine physical access data with HR and scheduling information for complete workforce oversight.

## Real-World Application

_A Serbian electronics manufacturer integrated Hexavera with HikVision across three plants, reducing unauthorized access incidents by 90% within the first quarter._

Security teams now monitor site occupancy in real-time, while HR automates attendance and compliance logging — all from within Hexavera.

## Conclusion

By integrating HikVision with Hexavera, manufacturers gain full-spectrum workforce visibility, streamline compliance, and ensure safer operations. This deep connection between access control and workforce management turns security into a proactive business advantage.
