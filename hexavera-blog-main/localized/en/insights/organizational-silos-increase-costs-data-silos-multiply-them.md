Organizational silos add 8–16% to workforce costs through coordination friction and decision delays. Data silos multiply this by 2–3x through information asymmetry and reconciliation burden. Combined fragmentation inflates labor variance by 18–32% compared to integrated operations.

## Quantified Outcomes

- 8–16% cost increase from organizational silos (coordination friction)
- 2–3x multiplier from data silos (reconciliation, duplication, asymmetry)
- 18–32% total labor variance attributable to combined fragmentation
- 40–60 hours monthly on cross-system reconciliation

## Exposure Profile

**Organizational Silos Create Coordination Friction:** HR optimizes for compliance and continuity. Operations optimizes for throughput and efficiency. Finance optimizes for cost control and reporting accuracy. Each function makes locally optimal decisions that create globally suboptimal outcomes. Coordination meetings consume 4–8 hours weekly without resolving structural misalignment.

**Data Silos Create Information Asymmetry:** HRIS contains employee records. Timekeeping contains attendance data. Payroll contains compensation data. MES contains production data. Each system holds partial truth. No single view exists for integrated decision-making. Supervisors make staffing decisions with incomplete information.

**Combined Fragmentation Compounds Costs:** Organizational friction (8–16%) meets data fragmentation (2–3x multiplier). HR approves leave without visibility to production requirements. Operations schedules overtime without visibility to compliance limits. Finance discovers variance without visibility to operational causes. Each function reacts to problems created by another function's decisions.

## Predictive Advantage

**Integrated Data Breaks Information Asymmetry:** Single workforce data platform provides consistent view across functions. HR sees production requirements. Operations sees compliance limits. Finance sees real-time cost impact. Decision-making becomes coordinated without requiring meeting escalation.

**Cross-Functional Visibility Enables Proactive Coordination:** Shared dashboards replace sequential communication. Production constraints visible to HR during leave approval. Compliance limits visible to operations during overtime authorization. Cost impact visible to all functions during scheduling decisions.

**Reconciliation Burden Collapses:** Monthly cross-system reconciliation (40–60 hours) drops to real-time validation (4–8 hours). Discrepancies surface immediately instead of accumulating to month-end crisis. Investigation becomes verification instead of discovery.

**Organizational Alignment Follows Data Integration:** Shared metrics create shared accountability. Functions optimize against common KPIs instead of conflicting objectives. Coordination friction drops as information asymmetry disappears.

## Operational Impact

**Labor variance drops 50–65%.** Organizations moving from siloed to integrated data architecture reduce variance from 18–32% to 6–12%. Remaining variance reflects operational decisions rather than information gaps.

**Cross-functional coordination accelerates.** Decision latency drops from 8–24 hours (meeting-dependent) to 1–2 hours (data-available). Staffing decisions incorporate production, compliance, and cost factors simultaneously.

**Investigation burden shifts to strategic analysis.** Finance teams redirect 30–50 hours monthly from reconciliation to value-added analysis. Root cause attribution becomes immediate instead of retrospective.

## Leadership Relevance

**CIO/CTO Perspective:** Data integration is architectural investment with immediate operational ROI. Integration projects achieve payback within 3–6 months through reconciliation reduction alone. Ongoing value compounds through decision acceleration and variance reduction.

**CFO Perspective:** Siloed data creates siloed costs that accumulate invisibly. Integration enables variance attribution and targeted intervention. Forecasting accuracy improves 12–25% when data reflects operational reality.

**COO Perspective:** Operational decisions require cross-functional visibility. Siloed data forces conservative assumptions. Integration enables confident, aggressive operational planning.
